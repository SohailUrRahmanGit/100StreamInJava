# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Java learning project focused on practicing Java Stream API examples. The project contains 100 Stream API exercises organized into 10 categories in README.md:
1. Stream Basics with Lists (Q1-Q10)
2. Stream Operations with Arrays (Q11-Q20)
3. Stream Operations with Strings (Q21-Q30)
4. Stream Operations with Maps (Q31-Q40)
5. Advanced Stream Operations (Q41-Q50)
6. Stream with Optional (Q51-Q60)
7. Stream with Primitives (Q61-Q70)
8. Collectors (Q71-Q80)
9. Parallel Streams (Q81-Q90)
10. Real-World/Challenging Problems (Q91-Q100)

## Project Structure

- `src/Main.java` - Contains Stream API examples as static methods called from main()
- `out/` - Compiled class files (generated by javac)
- `README.md` - Contains all 100 practice questions
- Plain Java project (no Maven/Gradle) configured for IntelliJ IDEA

## Development Commands

**Compile and run:**
```bash
javac src/Main.java -d out/
java -cp out/ Main
```

**Run in IntelliJ IDEA:**
- Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
- Right-click on Main.java and select "Run 'Main.main()'"

## Architecture

The codebase follows a simple tutorial/example structure:
- Each Stream API example is implemented as a static method in the Main class
- Methods are called sequentially from the main() method
- Each example demonstrates a specific Stream API operation or pattern

## Adding New Stream Examples

When adding new Stream examples:
1. Create a new static method in Main class with a descriptive name (e.g., `filterEvenNumbers()`, `mapToUpperCase()`)
2. Add a comment header above the method call in main() indicating the question number and description from README.md
3. Call the method from main()
4. Include console output to show the results
5. Use separator lines (`System.out.println("---------------------------")`) for readability between outputs

## Current Progress

To see which questions have been implemented, search for question numbers in `src/Main.java`. Each implemented solution has a comment in main() with the corresponding question number from README.md.
